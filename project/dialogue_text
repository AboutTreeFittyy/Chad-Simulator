Girls backahndedly give controls to player:

Don't you DARE let any of those LAME missiles touch Chad! 
I swear if you even let one bit of LAME on Chad, I'm walking
out on you! Just use his HOT STUFF by pressing W to fight back.
Like OMG! Do you even have a brain?!

UGHHH! Chad's letting you control him with A to go left and 
D to go right!?!? He won't even listen to me and TURN OFF that
damn MUSIC using CTRL+M!! ...AND he gives you HELP/PAUSES when 
you press CTRL+P or CTRL+H! OMG. I. Can't. Even.

You better clear those LOSERS off the beach before they touch 
down and ruin my vibes. Oh and don't even think of trying to
QUIT by pressing ESC! Chad's not a quitter! If you let him
down, I'll NEVER let you live it down!


Gameplay idea:
Maybe save 12 different versions of the chicks picture and have the amount of girls left at the end
vary based on the score 


Chad introduces game on the title screen:


Sup Bro! Want to play one of my favourite games with me?
It's super hype bro, trust me. Whenever I go on the beach 
I keep all of the fatties and nerd losers away from me
and the babes by showing off my guns to them! It's so
much fun dude, trust me you'll do great and the chicks 
will love you for it! Look! Here comes some dorks now!

Jokes:
-Body attracts women of all art styles
-Wears a shirt and pants to beach. Still looks great
-surrounded by a dozen women. Its a slow night for him
